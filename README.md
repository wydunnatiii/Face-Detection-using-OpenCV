Face Detection using OpenCV
This project demonstrates a simple face detection system using OpenCV. The system uses the Haar Cascade classifier to identify faces in real-time via a webcam or in static images.

Key Features:
Real-time Face Detection: Detects faces from live webcam feed.
Image Face Detection: Processes static images to identify and highlight faces.
Haar Cascade Classifier: Utilizes pre-trained Haar Cascade models for accurate face detection.
OpenCV Integration: Built with OpenCV for robust computer vision capabilities.
